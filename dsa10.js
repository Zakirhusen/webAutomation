// Coprime Divisors
// Problem Statement

// Antonio is very spectacular about arrays. He just hates when any two elements of the array have anything in common.

// Hence he considers an array GOOD if and only if the GCD of any two elements of the array is no more than one(in other words the elements have nothing in common).

// Given an integer N, help Antonio to form an array(say A) of maximum size such that :

// Each element of array A is a divisor of N.
// Array A must be a GOOD array.
// All elements of array A must be unique.
// You donâ€™t have to find the entire array A, but only its maximum possible size.



// Input Format



// The first line of input contains a single integer denoting N.


// Output Format



// Print the maximum possible size of array A such that it satisfies the given conditions.


// Constraints



// 1<=N<=1012


// Sample Input 1



// 12



// Sample Output 1



// 3



// Explanation of Sample 1



// Let array A = [1,2,3].

// Then each element of array A divides N.

// Also GCD of any two elements of the array A is always 1. Hence it is also a GOOD array.



// Things to Note for the Candidate: You can use your own IDE like Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or any other IDE that you are comfortable with to build your solution code.

// The IDE provided on the platform is purely for submission. Avoid using the IDE for coding out the solution.

// Test against any custom input in your own IDE. In the IDE provided on the platform, you cannot pass custom test cases and see the output.

// Use standard input and standard output in your program for the IDE to run the test cases smoothly against your code. We are giving a sample problem statement along with a solution that will pass the test cases in the IDE. - Sample Problem Statement (Right Click and Open in New Tab to view.)
